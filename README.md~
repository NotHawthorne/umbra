###Description  
Developed by [NotHawthorne](https://github.com/NotHawthorne), umbra is a decentralized social networking solution. This means that umbra:  
 * Does not store or log any message or profile information.  
 * Operates on a peer-to-peer basis. Your posts, pictures, profile data, and messages are sent directly to the intended recipient, without passing through a central database. Your information is YOUR business.  
  
If you feel uncomfortable with the idea that governments or private companies might have access to your private messages, umbra is the service for you.  

###Binary Installation - Ubuntu 14.04 x64
