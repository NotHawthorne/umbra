Requires the [qt](https://github.com/qtproject/qt5) libraries to build. Built on Ubuntu 14.04, untested on other operating systems. Add a new folder named "shhdir" to the bin directory, and unzip [these files](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s122lqndpzl5aml/shhdir.zip?dl=0) into it, or the program will not function.
